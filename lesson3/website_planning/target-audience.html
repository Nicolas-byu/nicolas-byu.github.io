        <p>
          The Jackson family loves to go out their house and enjoy nature.
          Sometimes they go out without knowing the weather and when they think
          the day is going to be sunny, the rain begans to fall. They need a
          website to tell them what tipe of weather is going to be in the
          specific area they are going to.
        </p>
        <h4>This is Harris.</h4>

        />
        <p>
          Harris loves to go to outdoor events, but he is been feeling fustrated
          lately because when he goes to an event, the event gets cancelled
          because of the weather condition. When he heard about our website he
          was very happy to hear that tuAfuera provides all the information
          about local events.
