        <p>
          The Jackson family loves to go out of their house and enjoy nature.
          Sometimes they go out without knowing the weather and when they think
          the day is going to be sunny, the rain begins to fall. They need a
          website to tell them what type of weather is going to be in the
          specific area they are going to.
        </p>
        <h4>This is Harris.</h4>
        <img

          alt="a picture of a happy family sitting in the grass."
        />
        <p>
          Harris loves to go to outdoor events, but he is been feeling
          frustrated lately because when he goes to an event, the event gets
          canceled because of the weather condition. When he heard about our
          website he was very happy to hear that tuAfuera provides all the
          information about local events.

      <h3>Scenarios</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Did the event in the Italian park get canceled?</li>
        <li>Is raining today? Are the restaurants open or closed?</li>
        <li>
          I know it's snowing but I don't know if the cableway in the San
          Cristobal mountain is going to be open.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to the weather condition, should I go to "El caj√≥n del
          Maipo"?
        </li>
        <li>
          There are strong winds in the region. I wonder if there is any zoo
          open today.
