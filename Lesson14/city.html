              Santiago, also known as Santiago de Chile, is the capital and
              largest city of Chile as well as one of the largest cities in the
              Americas. It is the center of Chile's most densely populated
              region, the Santiago Metropolitan Region, whose total population
              is 7 million, of which more than 6 million live in the city's
              continuous urban area. The city is entirely in the country's
              central valley. Most of the city lies between 500–650 m
              (1,640–2,133 ft) above mean sea level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Founded in 1541 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia,
              Santiago has been the capital city of Chile since colonial times.
              The city has a downtown core of 19th-century neoclassical
              architecture and winding side-streets, dotted by art deco,
              neo-gothic, and other styles. Santiago's cityscape is shaped by
              several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing Mapocho River,
              lined by parks such as Parque Forestal and Balmaceda Park. The
              Andes Mountains can be seen from most points in the city. These
              mountains contribute to a considerable smog problem, particularly
              during winter, due to the lack of rain. The city outskirts are
              surrounded by vineyards and Santiago is within an hour of both the
              mountains and the Pacific Ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              Santiago is the cultural, political and financial center of Chile
              and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational
              corporations. The Chilean executive and judiciary are located in
              Santiago, but Congress meets mostly in nearby Valparaíso. Santiago
              is named after the biblical figure St. James. Santiago will host
              the 2023 Pan American Games.

              The population of Santiago has seen a steady increase in recent
              years. In 1990 the total population under 20 years was 38.0% and
              8.9% were over 60. Estimates in 2007 show that 32.9% of men and
              30.7% of women were less than 20 years old, while 10.2% of men and
              13.4% of women were over 60 years. For the year 2020, it is
              estimated that the figures will be 26.7% and 16.8%.

              4,313,719 people in Chile say they were born in one of the
              communes of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, which, according to
              the 2002 census, amounts to 28.5% of the national total. 67.6% of
              the inhabitants of Santiago claim to have been born in one of the
              communes of the metropolitan area. In communes such as Santiago
              Centro and Independencia, according to 2017 census, 1/3 of
              residents is a Latin American immigrant (28% and 31% of the
              population of these communes, respectively). Other communes of
              Greater Santiago with high numbers of immigrants are Estación
              Central (17%) and Recoleta (16%).
